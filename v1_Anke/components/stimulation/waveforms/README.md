# Definition of the waveforms
- all waveform trains contain 20 pulses and have a duration of 100 ms (200Hz train)
- waveform_0: symmetric cathodic first, each phase lasting 200Âµs
- waveform_-2: asymmetric cathodic first, anodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 2 duration extended by factor 2
- waveform_-4: asymmetric cathodic first, anodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 4 duration extended by factor 4
- waveform_-8: asymmetric cathodic first, anodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 8 duration extended by factor 8
- waveform_2: asymmetric cathodic first, cathodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 2 duration extended by factor 2
- waveform_-: asymmetric cathodic first, cathodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 4 duration extended by factor 4
- waveform_-: asymmetric cathodic first, cathodic phase amplitude divided by a factor 8 duration extended by factor 8
