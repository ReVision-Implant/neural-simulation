VND installation
================

Download and installation guide at `<https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vnd/>`_.

I couldn't get the final step of adding to the directory to PATH to work, but a workaround to launch vnd is to just type

``$ /[vnd-install-location]/bin/vnd}``

or navigate to the ``[vnd-install-location]/bin`` directory and type

``$ ./vnd``
