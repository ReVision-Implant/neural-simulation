# ReVision Implant neural simulation


This GitHub repository contains the data and code that is required to simulate extracellular stimulation with a biophysically detailed model of mouse V1. It contains most of the Allen Institute's [BMTK repo](https://www.github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk), as well as the required files from the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5u31m3hq6u2x5m/AACpYpeWnm6s_qJDpmgrYgP7a?dl=0) of the Allen Institute's [mouse V1 model](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/models/mv1-all-layers).
