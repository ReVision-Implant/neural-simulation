# ReVision Implant neural simulation

This GitHub repository contains the data and code that is required to simulate extracellular stimulation with a biophysically detailed model of mouse V1. It contains most of the Allen Institute's [BMTK repo](https://www.github.com/AllenInstitute/bmtk), as well as the required files from the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5u31m3hq6u2x5m/AACpYpeWnm6s_qJDpmgrYgP7a?dl=0) of the Allen Institute's [mouse V1 model](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/models/mv1-all-layers). 

# Manual: Hybrid modelling with BMTK and COMSOL

The [docs/manual/](docs/manual/) directory also contains a manual that documents how to use this software in the hybrid modelling approach. You can access it through the table of contents below.
